    <h2>Introduction to Programming</h2>
    <p>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. This involves writing code in a programming language. The code is then compiled or interpreted to be executed by the computer.</p>

    <h2>The Art of Coding</h2>
    <p>Writing code, also known as coding, requires understanding the syntax and semantics of a programming language, the problem domain, and the logic of the algorithm or method being implemented. Coding is the primary activity in the programming process.</p>

    <h2>Programming Paradigms</h2>
    <p>Different programming languages support different styles or 'paradigms' of programming. Some of the common paradigms include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Procedural programming</li>
      <li>Object-oriented programming</li>
      <li>Functional programming</li>
      <li>Logic programming</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>Programming languages are formal computer languages designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. They are used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>

    <h2>Overview of Some Programming Languages</h2>

                <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a></td>
                <td>A high-level, interpreted language known for its readability and simplicity. Supports multiple programming paradigms. Widely used in web development, data analysis, AI, and more.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></td>
                <td>Primarily used in web development to add interactive elements to websites. An interpreted, high-level language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.</td>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Understanding programming and programming languages is a fundamental part of computer science and is essential for developing software and applications. By learning different programming languages, one can choose the best language to use for a given task.</p>
